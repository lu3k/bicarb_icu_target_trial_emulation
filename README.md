# Bicarb ICU Target Trial emulation 

## Usage 
To generate the cohort run the bicarb_build_cohort.py file, this should build the cohort in the bicarb_data directory. 
Import the biuild_analysis_df.py to build the necessary structures for analysis.
Use analyse.py to perform analysis. 

## TODO : 
- cohort size very small after selection of acidosis criteria ? is there an error ?
- SOFA and eGFG data calculated based on "homemade" model, not the reprodICU standard. (doesn't compile on my computer)
- Rebuild as original study
